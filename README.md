# Instructions to Use
1. Download .sql file 
2. Open it in DataGrip 
3. Connect to the redshift DB and assignments database
4. Each answer is a single query or CTE that can be run independently 
5. For the OPTIONAL visualition task, I created a simple dashboard in Data Studio located here: https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/24469630-c29e-461f-89ec-42755ad2da29/page/1HQvC 

# Documentation 
- I used DataGrip for my exploration of the data and answering the questions because it was easy to connect to the database and was recomended in the take home
- I used SQL because it is my most confident programming language for manipulating data and thats what SQL is built to do so an added plus
- I exported the data I wanted to use for the visualization using the last query in the .sql file into a .csv file which I then uploaded to Data Studio. I did the ETL this way because it was the fasted way for me to stay under the 3 hour time limit.
